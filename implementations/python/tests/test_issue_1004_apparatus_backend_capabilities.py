"""Issue #1004 adversarial-control apparatus and backend capability declarations.

These tests pin the declaration-only extension of the API-407
``capabilities.participant_runtime.feature_support`` surface with five governed
behavior-feature terms: SEM-233 boundary flow resolution, RUN-319 final-sink
mediation, bounded quarantined processing, trusted/untrusted processing-role
declaration, and monitor-topology declaration.

A declaration is never proof of realization, isolation, monitor independence,
non-collusion, flow propagation, or sink enforcement. Missing, contradictory, or
evidence-free declarations are deny-equivalent, and a weakened claim never
retains the stronger effective level without an explicitly authorized downgrade.
