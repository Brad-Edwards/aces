"""Internal assembled evidence types for bounded repeatability-consistency.

These types support ASR-514 determinism, stability, and replay-consistency
verification. One comparison is a single binary baseline-to-repetition pair
under the exact ``canonical-artifact-identity`` relation; a larger set of
repeated runs composes as several pairwise cases.

Trust boundary: ``compare_repeatability_consistency`` and
``assemble_repeatability_consistency_evidence`` are a trusted-composition-only
surface, invoked by code that already owns the validator authority and the case.
The module-owned assembly token is integrity defense-in-depth - it detects
accidental or unsealed construction - not an access-control boundary against a
caller that is already trusted to drive the comparator. Each evidence reference
is bound to the digest-verified run's declared evidence set (see
``repeatability_evidence``); content authenticity of an individual evidence
record remains owned by the platform evidence provenance layer.
