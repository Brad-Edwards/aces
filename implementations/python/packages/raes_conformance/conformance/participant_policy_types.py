"""ASR-535 participant-policy probe vocabulary.

The declarative half of the probe family: the closed operation and expectation
vocabularies, the case record a harness fills in, the harness protocol, and the
claim binding used when a declaration was never established. The runner that
executes these cases and judges their outcome lives in
``participant_policy_probes``; keeping the vocabulary separate makes it obvious
that a harness contributes inputs and expectations, never a verdict.
