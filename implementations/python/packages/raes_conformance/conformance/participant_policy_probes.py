"""ASR-535 participant-policy conformance probes.

API-407 lets a backend *declare* participant information-flow support. Before
this module the target runner projected that declaration straight into a passing
conformance case, so a backend could declare exact support and conform without
any participant-policy behavior ever being driven. Declaration is not
realization.

**The runner owns execution and the verdict.** A harness supplies declarative
case inputs — the deployment's policy resolver, the participant and audience
coordinates, the typed carriers, and the expected disposition — and nothing
else. It never supplies a control plane, a boolean outcome, or a side-effect
fact. The runner constructs the real :class:`RuntimeControlPlane` on the target
under evaluation, wraps that target's participant runtime in a call counter,
invokes the typed boundary itself, and derives every reported fact from the raw
boundary result plus its own before/after ledger. A harness able to supply the
execution object or the verdict could certify a backend it never ran, which is
precisely the substitution this probe family exists to detect.

The probe set is finite falsification evidence for the named target, profile,
and cases. It establishes no universal property: the report relation stays
``bounded-probe-success``, and a case that references the SEM-230
``policy-noninterference`` obligation is recording what it attempted to falsify,
not asserting that the obligation holds.
