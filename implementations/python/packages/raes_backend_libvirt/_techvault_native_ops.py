"""Diagnostic codes and low-level native-object helpers for the TechVault driver.

Holds the shared diagnostic-code constants, the native-resource protocol, and the
thin libvirt-call/name-availability/artifact-token/diagnostic helpers used by the
native TechVault driver and its teardown paths. Split from
:mod:`raes_backend_libvirt.techvault_native` to keep that module under the ADR-015
source-size cap; the driver re-imports these names so existing call sites and the
guest-certified subclass's ``_artifact_token`` import stay stable.
