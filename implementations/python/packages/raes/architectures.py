"""Governed target-node CPU architecture vocabulary (issue #674).

The single source of truth for the SDL target-node CPU architecture requirement:
its canonical enumeration, authoring aliases, governed-extension form, the
field-aware normalizer shared by ``Node.architecture`` and
``RuntimePackage.architecture``, and the deterministic compatibility primitive.

Semantics (see ``docs/decisions/issue-674-target-node-cpu-architecture-preflight.md``):

- Canonical tokens are deliberately small: ``x86_64`` and ``aarch64``. Authoring
  aliases (``amd64``/``x64``/``x86-64`` and ``arm64``) normalize to them.
- Normalization is case-insensitive and applies the shared hyphen-to-underscore
  rule before alias resolution; canonical serialization emits the canonical token.
- Unknown unqualified strings fail closed. A custom architecture is admitted only
  in the governed-extension form ``x-<owner>:<term>`` (canonical lowercase), which
  compares by exact token with no implicit aliases.
- Absence (``None`` / unset) means no authored architecture requirement; it never
  implies the host, runner, image, or package architecture.

Keeping this vocabulary in one module — rather than duplicating alias maps in the
model, planner, backend, and envelope layers — is the ADR-012 portable-vocabulary
discipline and the anti-duplication guardrail from the preflight note.
