"""Enum vocabularies for the ``runtime.forwarding_agents`` family (SCN-010 §5.5).

Split out of ``runtime_forwarding_agent.py`` so neither source file exceeds the
ADR-015 600-line cap. Every enum here is an OPEN taxonomy carrying both
``unknown`` and ``other`` sentinels, except the small CLOSED structural sets
called out per the enum-sentinel discipline (§6): the enrollment-identity
