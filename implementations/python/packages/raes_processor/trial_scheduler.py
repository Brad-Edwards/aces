"""Deterministic batch-trial scheduling over the one-entry realization seam (SCE-006).

This is the repository-owned, schedule-independent handoff an orchestrator (APTL, or
any other coordinator) uses to run an admitted trial plan. It is an outer
coordinator over :func:`realize_admitted_trial_entry`: it may only choose
placement, deterministic order, bounded parallelism, timeouts, cancellation, and
cleanup (SVR-031). It never composes SDL, selects a variation, draws randomness,
allocates a ``run_id``, interprets factors, or scores.

:func:`plan_batch_schedule` is pure. It validates and integrity-checks the
*complete* admitted plan before exposing any entry, derives the canonical
dispatch order from the plan's ``trial-coordinate-v1`` coordinates, and reports
the *admitted parallelism ceiling* -- the maximum concurrency the sealed plan's
own embedded isolation proof authorizes (one when there is no such proof). It
deliberately does NOT decide the effective concurrency: proving live,
non-overlapping, currently-owned range/host/port/storage/lock/secret leases is
the downstream allocator's responsibility, and a non-empty tuple of caller
reference strings is not proof of any of that. The allocator decides an
effective bound no greater than the ceiling and records it, with its live lease
evidence, in a :class:`BatchExecutionReceiptModel` via
:func:`build_batch_execution_receipt`; that receipt records the allocator's
decision rather than authorizing it.
