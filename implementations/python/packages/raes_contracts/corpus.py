"""Single seam for resolving the published RAES contract corpus.

The ``contracts/`` tree at the repository root is the hand-governed normative
authority (ADR-009): published schemas, the fixture conformance corpus, backend
and semantic capability profiles, and the concept-authority catalogs. Every
loader that reads that corpus resolves through this module rather than
reconstructing a repository path, so:

* an **installed distribution** finds the corpus shipped as package data under
  ``raes_contracts/_corpus`` (see the wheel/sdist ``force-include`` in
  ``implementations/python/pyproject.toml``), resolved via
  ``importlib.resources`` so it is install-layout independent; and
* a **source / editable checkout** finds the in-repo ``contracts/`` authority.

This is the single extension seam: adding a future corpus family needs one
``force-include`` pattern and one call site through :func:`corpus_family_root`,
not a new ``Path(__file__).parents[N]`` heuristic in every loader.

Caller-controlled override roots (``--fixtures-root`` / ``--profiles-root``) are
deliberately *not* handled here; they stay explicit inputs at the loader
boundary, distinct from the packaged-resource default.
