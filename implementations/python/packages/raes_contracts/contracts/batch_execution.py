"""Isolated batch-trial scheduling handoff and evidence contracts (SCE-006).

The scheduler is an outer coordinator over the existing one-entry realization
seam (ADR-084; ``specs/formal/scenario-variation-trial-realization/README.md``
invariants SVR-014, SVR-019..022, SVR-031). It may choose placement, order,
bounded parallelism, timeouts, cancellation, and cleanup only; it never composes
SDL, selects a variation, draws randomness, allocates a ``run_id``, or scores.

Authority boundary. This layer never turns a caller-presented reference string
into live parallelism authority. The *admitted* concurrency ceiling comes only
from an isolation proof that is embedded in the sealed plan (bound to the plan
by its digest). The *effective* concurrency actually run, and the live lease
evidence backing it, are decided by the downstream allocator (APTL) against
resources this repository cannot certify; a receipt therefore *records* that
prior allocator decision as evidence and this layer verifies only that the
recorded claim is authorized by the sealed plan's own proof -- it does not, and
cannot, verify live lease ownership, currentness, or fencing.

This module publishes:

- :func:`validate_scheduler_isolation_proof` -- structural consistency of an
  isolation proof against a plan's admitted entries (membership plus, for
  bounded parallelism, cleanup-boundary resource non-overlap). It is a
  consistency check, not an authorization: parallel authority is only ever the
  plan's *embedded* proof, which the sealed ``plan_digest`` binds to the plan.
- :class:`BatchExecutionReceiptModel` -- one immutable attempt receipt that
  *composes* (never replaces) the incumbent operation and cleanup authorities.
  :func:`validate_batch_execution_receipt` joins it to the exact sealed plan,
  verifies the recorded dispatch ordinal against the one canonical order,
  authorizes any bounded-parallelism claim only from the plan's embedded proof,
  and requires a matching, successfully validated cleanup receipt so a failed or
  suppressed cleanup can never be reported as a clean successful trial.
