"""Canonical dispatch ordering for admitted ``trial-coordinate-v1`` entries.

This is the single owning post-serialization order helper for admitted trial
coordinates (SVR-014 schedule independence, SVR-031 scheduler opacity). Both the
processor scheduling policy and the contract-layer receipt validator reuse it so
a recorded dispatch ordinal can be verified against the one canonical order
rather than trusted as a free-form claim. It lives in the contract layer because
the canonical order of an admitted coordinate set is a property of the sealed
plan contract, not of any particular scheduler.
