# EXP-710 — Provenance And Traceability

## Statement

The ecosystem shall preserve traceability from task and run context through captured evidence to derived measures, evaluations, and experiment claims.

## Rationale

Requirement inventory expansion. Experiment claims require provenance and traceability rather than unsupported interpretation.

## Traceability

- IMPLEMENTS → SPEC `contracts/schemas/experiment-core/experiment-run-v1.json` (Experiment run v1 published schema)
- TESTS → TEST `implementations/python/tests/test_runtime_contracts.py` (Experiment run provenance runtime contract tests)
- DOCUMENTS → ADR `docs/decisions/adrs/adr-065-experiment-run-provenance-contract-boundary.md` (ADR-065 Experiment run provenance contract boundary)
