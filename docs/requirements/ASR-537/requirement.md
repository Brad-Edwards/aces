# ASR-537 — Cross-Backend Participant-Control Realization and Transfer Evidence

## Statement

RAES SHALL define and execute a revision-pinned cross-backend participant-control evidence protocol that: (1) evaluates the same authored participant-control policy in pure simulation, pure emulation/operation, simultaneous mixed composition, and linked or pre-admitted staged realization cases; (2) binds every result to scenario/policy digests, trial/run identity, apparatus and adapter identities, capability and conformance results, realization allocation/topology, clock/order mappings, data/model/seed provenance, losses, limitations, and reproduction evidence; (3) includes stale handoff, concurrent intervention, unsupported or falsely declared capability, timestamp-only or unmapped ordering, simulation-only observation, unrealizable action, directed-delivery failure, prior-delivery retraction, and bridge-metadata leakage cases; (4) requires rejection or zero prohibited effects where authority, policy, mapping, admission, or commit fails; and (5) reports bounded conformance, interoperability readiness, empirical sim-to-em transfer, trace inclusion, bisimulation, IFC/noninterference, and backend equivalence as distinct claims with no silent promotion.

## Rationale

Shared action/observation interfaces and paired backend runs do not establish simultaneous mixed realization, semantic equivalence, or transfer. Current cyber-range evidence shows material sim/em mismatch, while DSEEP, SIRL, HLA, co-simulation, and digital-twin precedents require purpose-bound apparatus, topology, time, provenance, uncertainty, and reproducibility evidence.
