# SEM-231 — Participant-Relative Predicate Opacity And Supervisor Observation Semantics

## Statement

The ecosystem shall define revisioned participant-relative predicate-opacity semantics over a declared possible-point carrier, with explicit observer or coalition, secret predicate, initial information, accumulated observation including supervisor decisions and observable omissions, memory and horizon, supervisor and policy visibility, passive or active strategy quantifiers, declassification, time and order, nondeterminism, concurrency, probability scope, and independent definition, bounded-checking, model-checking, proof, runtime-enforcement, backend-declaration, backend-realization, and conformance states, without conflating opacity with policy noninterference, projected-history equality, epistemic indistinguishability, trace relations, simulation, refinement, or bisimulation.

## Rationale

SEM-230 governs participant-policy noninterference, but it intentionally delegates selected-secret opacity and supervisor-visibility semantics. Without a separate predicate-opacity authority, equal projected histories, hidden supervisor implementations, finite probes, randomization, or declassification could be misreported as opacity. This requirement supplies the missing one-sided epistemic relation while preserving the incumbent participant carriers and independent assurance axes.
