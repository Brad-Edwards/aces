# ACT-604 — Dynamic Knowledge And Environment-State Semantics

## Statement

The ecosystem shall define dynamic participant knowledge and environment-state semantics, including evolving operational holdings, discovered context, and shared state.

## Rationale

Requirement inventory expansion. Rich participant behavior requires portable semantics for what actors know, hold, discover, and affect over time.

## Traceability
