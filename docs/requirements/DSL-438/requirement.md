# DSL-438 — Target-Node CPU Architecture Semantics

## Statement

The language shall represent a target-node CPU architecture requirement as a first-class, optional VM-node attribute drawn from a governed canonical vocabulary with authoring aliases, case-insensitive normalization, and a governed extension form for custom values, kept distinct from runtime-package artifact architecture and from backend host architecture; shall define deterministic, fail-closed compatibility between a target node and each architecture-constrained runtime package, including that a node without a target architecture may not carry an architecture-constrained package; shall give absence explicit no-requirement semantics that never infer the controller, host, runner, image, or emulator default architecture; and shall expose the requirement to backend realization-support disclosure so a conformant backend can report whether it can realize the target architecture without the processor selecting a runner.

## Rationale

Issue #674: the SDL Node model had no CPU architecture attribute — Resources carried only RAM and CPU count, and the runtime-package architecture field describes a package artifact, not the architecture the target node or guest requires. Without a first-class, governed target-node architecture, an authored environment cannot express a realization-relevant node constraint and cross-backend equivalence is ambiguous. RAES owns the controlled architecture value, schema placement, normalization, and target/package compatibility; env-packs, adapters, and backends retain physical host capability, selection, negotiation, and realization evidence.
