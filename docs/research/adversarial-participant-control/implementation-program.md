# Adversarial Participant Control Implementation Program

Date: 2026-07-30

Parent issue: [#812](https://github.com/RAESystem/rae/issues/812)

Milestone: `Participant Information-Flow & Behavioral Equivalence`

## Definition delivered by issue 812

Issue #812 delivers ADR-101, the primary-source gap assessment, revisioned
threat model, SEM-233 flow-policy profile, ASR-536 control-evaluation profile,
four worked attack designs, two canonical DRAFT requirements, and the ordered
program.

It does not publish wire contracts, change runtime enforcement, prove backend
realization, run the attack cases, or establish intentional-subversion
robustness.

## Work packages

### #1001: Semantic authority

Publish the two-coordinate label algebra, conservative derivation, release
operations, final-sink relation, cross-participant/episode carriage, and
bounded falsification authority.

### #1002: Portable contracts

Publish closed label, derivation, release, sink-decision, and existing-carrier
binding contracts with contextual validation, fixtures, publication, and
generator parity.

### #1003: Runtime enforcement

Drive the real final boundary, commit before effect, and demonstrate zero
prohibited calls or disclosure for every denial, stale, unsupported, replay,
and persistence-conflict class.

### #1004: Apparatus and backend support

Declare quarantine, flow, monitor-topology, and sink-mediation capabilities;
resolve effective support deny-first; and publish bounded realization and
conformance evidence.

### #1007: Adversarial evaluation

Run honest and adaptive attack modes under declared knowledge, collusion,
monitor, audit, intervention, memory, and replay coordinates. Report safety,
usefulness, cost, uncertainty, limitations, and nonclaims separately.

### #1008: Documentation and claims

Only after #1003, #1004, and #1007 reconcile their evidence, update scientific
completeness, assurance status, lineage, and public guidance with the exact
implemented and evaluated profiles.

## Program invariants

- Confidentiality and integrity stay independent.
- Unknown or missing flow state never becomes public or trusted.
- Declassification, endorsement, authorization, admission, approval,
  authentication, editing, and execution stay distinct.
- The final decision is committed immediately before effect or disclosure.
- A monitor score never authorizes an action.
- Honest and attack modes, knowledge, adaptation, collusion, audit, monitor
  correlation, and memory are explicit.
- Every denial case checks zero prohibited external effects.
- Human, scripted, RL, LLM, and external-service participants share portable
  semantics; apparatus internals remain capability declarations.
- Chain-of-thought, private model state, credentials, hidden objectives, and
  raw secrets remain outside portable evidence.
- Runtime, backend, intentional-subversion, alignment, monitor-trust, and
  covert-channel claims require separate exact evidence.
