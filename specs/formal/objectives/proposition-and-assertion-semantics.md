# Proposition, Assertion, and Truth-Result Semantics

## Authority and claim level

This FM2 specification realizes [ADR-078](../../../docs/decisions/adrs/adr-078-backend-neutral-proposition-and-truth-semantics.md).
The published JSON Schemas govern serialized shapes. The equations below govern
the reference truth algebra. Runtime tests and fixtures provide bounded
assurance; ACES does not claim a mechanized proof.

## Domains

For an instantiated scenario `S`:

```text
Subject(S)      = finite set of canonically addressable SDL resources
Truth           = {T, F, U}
Support         = {supported, unsupported}
PortableOutcome = {true, false, unknown, unsupported}
```

`unsupported` belongs to `PortableOutcome` but not `Truth`. It reports a failed
realization obligation, not a fact about the scenario world.

A proposition `p` is:

```text
p = (subjects, basis, predicate, quantifier, threshold, evidence_requirements)
```

where `subjects` is non-empty and finite; `basis` is `declared_state` or
`observed_state`; `predicate` is one member of the closed typed union; and
`threshold` exists exactly when `quantifier = at_least`.

The predicate is evaluated once per resolved subject. The proposition outcome
is the finite aggregation of those per-subject outcomes: `all` uses `all_of`,
`any` uses `any_of`, and `at_least(k)` uses the same `at_least(k)` table defined
below. Subject order has no semantic effect.

An assertion `a` is:

```text
a = (proposition_ref, role, polarity)
role     in {precondition, invariant, postcondition}
polarity in {positive, negative}
```

The owning objective/event/workflow/participant reference supplies scope. A
role does not create a clock.

## Predicate typing

```text
presence : property -> exists
boolean  : property x {equals, not_equals} x Bool
string   : property x {equals, not_equals} x String
         | property x {in, not_in} x NonEmptyUniqueList(String)
number   : property x OrderedComparison x FiniteNumber x Unit
```

Every property has a stable HTTPS/URN semantic reference. Numeric units have a
separate semantic reference. No implicit string-to-number or Boolean-to-number
coercion is permitted.

## Negation and composition

Let portable negation `not4` be:

| x | `not4(x)` |
|---|---|
| true | false |
| false | true |
| unknown | unknown |
| unsupported | unsupported |

Positive assertions preserve a proposition outcome; negative assertions apply
`not4`.

For non-empty sequence `xs`:

```text
all_of(xs) = false        if false in xs
           = true         if every x is true
           = unsupported  if unsupported in xs
           = unknown      otherwise

any_of(xs) = true         if true in xs
           = false        if every x is false
           = unsupported  if unsupported in xs
           = unknown      otherwise
```

For `at_least(k, xs)`, let `t` be the count of true values and `d` the count of
unknown plus unsupported values:

```text
at_least(k, xs) = true         if t >= k
                = false        if t + d < k
                = unsupported  if unsupported in xs
                = unknown      otherwise
```

`1 <= k <= |xs|`. Empty composition is undefined and rejected.

## Evidence admission

For an observed-state result `r`:

```text
Decided(r) => ProbeBinding(r)
              and NonEmpty(EvidenceRefs(r))
              and GovernedTemporalContext(r)
```

For a declared-state result:

```text
Decided(r) => InstantiatedArtifactDigest(r)
```

For every decided result:

```text
all(loss.within_admissible_bound for loss in r.loss_disclosures)
```

Missing, stale, partial, conflicting, redacted, lossy, or probe-failure evidence
produces `unknown` with a typed reason unless an admitted rule proves the loss
is within its bound. Missing capability produces `unsupported` with at least
one capability reference.

## Role admission

- Objective success references only invariant or postcondition assertions.
- Event triggers, workflow state predicates, and participant starting state
  reference only precondition assertions.
- False, unknown, or unsupported preconditions do not establish applicability.
- A postcondition is not established by command completion or evaluator
  lifecycle success.
- A sampled point does not prove an interval invariant without a governed
  coverage contract.

## Equivalence boundary

`semantic_claim(r)` projects:

```text
(proposition, assertion, polarity, proposition_outcome, assertion_outcome,
 basis, indeterminacy_reason, temporal_context, loss_disclosures,
 unsupported_capabilities)
```

Equality of this projection permits comparing the same claim realized by
different bindings while retaining distinct binding/evidence provenance. It is
not a bisimulation claim. Park-style bisimulation would additionally require a
labelled transition system, an observation boundary, hidden-action treatment,
and a relation preserved by every transition.

## Realization mapping

The compiler emits separate proposition and assertion resources. A condition
binding may point to a proposition resource but cannot change its predicate.
The backend manifest declares supported predicate families, quantifiers,
portable outcomes, evidence channels, time domains, and binding-provenance
preservation. Admission reports unsupported instead of substituting a weaker
predicate or clock.

A runtime truth result is admitted only if its proposition and assertion
addresses resolve to semantic entries in the same snapshot, the proposition
entry has the same evaluation basis, and the assertion entry has the same
proposition link and polarity. This prevents a structurally valid envelope from
changing or detaching the compiled claim.
