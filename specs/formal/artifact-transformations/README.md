# Artifact transformation invariants

This subsystem defines the bounded FM2 obligations for AUT-810. The executable
surface consists of operation-specific functions in `raes.transformations`,
the closed `artifact-transformation-report/v1` contract, and the focused
transformation conformance corpus. It is not a generic patch or migration
language.

## Invariants

For an admitted source artifact (S), explicit request (R), and closed policy
(P), an operation returns exactly one of:

1. **Complete success:** an independently reconstructed and admitted target
   (T), plus a report whose target digest binds (T); or
2. **Complete refusal:** no target and a report containing at least one bounded
   diagnostic for a failed condition.

The following invariants hold for both outcomes:

- **Purity and isolation.** The output is a newly admitted value derived only
  from explicit arguments. The source's canonical bytes do not change.
- **Determinism.** Equal canonical inputs, request, and policy produce equal
  canonical output and equal reports. Reports contain no clock, random,
  filesystem, network, process, or caller-identity input.
- **Exact selection.** SDL declarations are selected by one exact canonical
  address. Aliases, collisions, unsupported identities, and ambiguity are
  refusals.
- **Admission closure.** Complete structural and semantic admission runs after
  every SDL candidate is reconstructed. A dangling or illegal resolved
  reference cannot be returned as output.
- **Named comparison.** Preservation is recorded under a named profile and a
  bounded evidence set, never as an unqualified Boolean claim.
- **Loss authorization.** Loss is rejected by default. Success with loss
  requires the policy to name every allowed loss kind and the report to carry
  the corresponding typed loss diagnostic.
- **Linked-artifact consistency.** Supplied external-concept subjects must bind
  the exact source digest. A rename retargets every supplied subject digest and
  the changed canonical reference atomically; stale documents cause refusal.

For declaration rename, let (f) map the selected address to its replacement
and act as identity elsewhere. The `sdl-declaration-identity-transport/v1`
check requires:

- (f) is injective over the declaration index;
- the declaration kind and declaration count are unchanged;
- every rewritten reference is admitted against the target index; and
- applying (f^{-1}) to the admitted target restores the source's canonical
  SDL bytes.

This is finite verification over the supplied artifacts. It does not prove
behavioral, observational, epistemic, strategic, backend, or scientific
equivalence. `canonical-artifact-identity` establishes equality only under the
named owning canonicalization profile.
