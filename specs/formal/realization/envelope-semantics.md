# Realization Envelope Semantics

This note defines the formal design boundary for issue #667. It extends the
SEM-218 realization model with a portable expression for a set of scenario
instances.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY**
in this note are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Scope

This note governs:

- envelope expressions authored in SDL or declared by a backend;
- scoped open/constrained/exact posture;
- closed-world semantics from field scope to scenario scope;
- instance membership;
- envelope subsumption;
- deterministic witness generation;
- negative conformance for closed envelopes;
- backend-manifest carriage constraints for schema evolution.

Out of scope:

- replacing `run_target_conformance(reference_scenario=...)`;
- adding implementation helpers, CLI commands, APIs, persistence, or runtime
  behavior;
- defining experiment-core run-set semantics;
- defining new SDL variable syntax beyond the existing variable catalog.

## Realization Status

This spec is design authority. The relation helper, the envelope expression
contract model, fixtures, and property tests are implemented by issue #668:

- `aces_contracts.realization_envelope` carries the closed, versioned envelope
  expression (`realization-envelope/v1`) — the admitted-fragment domain kinds,
  scoped bindings, posture, closure, and witness policy of this note;
- `aces_sdl.realization_envelope` implements `member`, `subsumes`, `witness`, and
  `generate_negative_probes` as one deterministic engine over that contract.

Issue #100 publishes the schema carrier at
`contracts/schemas/realization-envelope/realization-envelope-v1.json`, packages governed
backend instances under `contracts/realization-envelopes/`, and carries an
immutable envelope/configuration identity through backend-manifest-v2,
provisioning-plan-v1, and runtime-snapshot-v1. Backend carriers embed this same
expression and add closed realization/observation disclosures; they do not
introduce a second set language.

The remaining downstream boundary is target-conformance integration:

- SEM-218 remains the active exact/constrained/open realization authority;
- `backend-manifest-v2.realization_support` remains the coarse capability floor,
  while the selected envelope is the configuration-bound value and disclosure
  authority;
- `run_target_conformance(reference_scenario=...)` remains the temporary #663
  bridge for fixed-topology and simulation backends.

## Canonical Inputs

Implementations of this spec MUST build on these authority surfaces:

- SDL variables and instantiation:
  [`specs/sdl/variables-and-instantiation.md`](../../sdl/variables-and-instantiation.md).
- SEM-218 explicitness and realization:
  [`explicitness-and-realization.md`](explicitness-and-realization.md).
- Backend manifest declarations:
  `BackendManifest`, `BackendManifestV2Model`, `backend_manifest_payload()`,
  and `RealizationSupportDeclaration`.
- Contract authority:
  `ContractModel`, `schema_bundle()`,
  `contracts/schema-publication-manifest.json`, and generated schema checks.
- Conformance/runtime diagnostics:
  `run_target_conformance()`, `OperationStatus`, and `Diagnostic`.

## Terms

**Scenario instance.** A fully instantiated, structurally valid, semantically
valid SDL scenario with no unresolved variables.

**Envelope expression.** A versioned expression denoting a set of scenario
instances.

**Domain descriptor.** A typed value set for one variable or field. The initial
portable domain kinds are `exact`, `enum`, `boolean`, `numeric-interval`,
`governed-reference`, and `record`.

**Scope.** The semantic extent where a posture applies. Scopes are ordered from
most local to broadest:

1. field
2. node
3. topology
4. app
5. scenario

`topology` and `app` are sibling aggregate scopes under `scenario`; neither is
more specific than the other for a field outside its aggregate.

**Posture.**

- `open`: the value or child scope is left to realization at a point the SDL
  semantics designates as realizable.
- `constrained`: the value or child scope MUST satisfy a typed domain.
- `exact`: the value or child scope MUST equal a singleton domain.

**Closure.**

- `open-world`: unspecified realizable dimensions under the scope may still be
  admitted when the owning SDL semantics allows them.
- `closed-world`: unspecified realizable dimensions under the scope are outside
  the envelope.

Closure is orthogonal to posture. A constrained field can live under an
open-world node, and an exact node can live under a closed-world scenario.

## Envelope Shape

An envelope expression consists of:

- `schema_version`: the envelope expression contract version;
- `id`: a stable local or published identifier;
- `scope`: the top-level scope the expression constrains;
- `domains`: named domain descriptors;
- `bindings`: scoped bindings from SDL paths or governed scope refs to domain
  descriptors and posture;
- `closure`: scoped open-world or closed-world overlays;
- optional `witness_policy`: deterministic default selection policy;
- optional `source_ref`, `contract_id`, and `digest` when the expression is
  referenced from another artifact.

The shape above is semantic, not yet a published JSON schema.

The relation operates on the **realization projection** of an admitted scenario,
not on every member of its exchange artifact. The projection excludes fields
annotated `x-aces-realization-dimension: false`. In
`instantiated-scenario-v1`, `instantiation_provenance` is such artifact metadata:
it remains mandatory for admission and participates in canonical snapshot
identity, but a backend neither chooses nor realizes it. Closed-world envelope
checks therefore MUST NOT treat that field as an unspecified realizable
dimension. This projection does not weaken provenance validation or remove the
field from the artifact.

## Required Semantics

### R1 - Envelopes denote sets

Every envelope expression denotes a set of scenario instances. A concrete
scenario instance `s` is a member of envelope `E` exactly when:

1. `s` is structurally and semantically valid under the ordinary SDL rules;
2. every effective binding in `E` is satisfied by the corresponding value or
   child scope in the realization projection of `s`;
3. every closed-world scope in `E` has no unspecified realizable dimension in
   the realization projection of `s`;
4. every governed reference in `E` resolves under the applicable concept or SDL
   authority.

Invalid SDL is never a member, even if it satisfies the envelope domains.

### R2 - Effective bindings use most-specific-wins

For a concrete SDL path, the effective binding is the most specific binding
whose scope contains that path.

If two bindings have equal specificity and incompatible domains or posture, the
envelope is invalid. If a more-specific binding widens a value that an enclosing
closed-world scope made exact or excluded, the envelope is invalid unless the
enclosing binding explicitly marks that child as overrideable.

Most-specific-wins is therefore deterministic; it is not merge-order dependent.

### R3 - Domain membership is structural

Domain descriptors admit only mechanically checkable sets:

- `exact(v)`: values equal to `v`;
- `enum({v1, ... vn})`: values equal to one listed member;
- `boolean`: `true` or `false`, optionally restricted to an exact boolean;
- `numeric-interval(type, lower, upper, lower_closed, upper_closed)`: numbers
  of the declared numeric type inside the bounded interval;
- `governed-reference(authority, allowed_refs)`: references in a finite
  governed set;
- `record(fields, extra)`: product structure whose field domains must be
  satisfied and whose `extra` flag controls undeclared fields.

Portable envelopes MUST NOT use arbitrary Python predicates, backend callbacks,
external queries, recursion, unbounded regex or SMT fragments, non-linear
arithmetic, or quantification over unbounded collections.

### R4 - Subsumption is set inclusion

`subsumes(offered, requested)` is true exactly when every scenario instance in
`requested` is also in `offered`.

The relation is evaluated without enumerating all instances. In the admitted
fragment it reduces to:

- domain subset checks for each effective binding;
- record/product field subset checks;
- closed-scope key-set checks;
- governed-reference subset checks;
- compatibility of posture and closure overlays.

When a backend declares `offered` and an author requests `requested`,
conformance may proceed only if `subsumes(offered, requested)` is true.

### R5 - Witness generation is deterministic and validated

`witness(E, policy, seed)` returns one concrete scenario instance in `E`, or a
diagnostic proving no witness can be generated in the admitted fragment.

The default policy is deterministic:

- exact domains choose their value;
- enums choose the lexicographically first canonical value unless a seed policy
  selects another member;
- bounded numeric intervals choose the lower closed endpoint when available,
  otherwise the smallest representable value inside the interval under the
  declared numeric type;
- governed references choose the first canonical ref unless a seed policy
  selects another allowed ref;
- records generate all required fields and no extra fields when closed.

The generated witness MUST be parsed, instantiated if needed, and semantically
validated through the normal SDL pipeline. A witness is executable evidence for
one instance. It is not a proof of subsumption or backend honesty.

### R6 - Closed envelopes require negative conformance

When a backend declares a closed-world envelope, conformance MUST generate
negative probes for closed dimensions that can be varied without introducing
secrets or unsafe side effects.

A negative probe is a request that differs from a valid witness by one
out-of-envelope variation:

- an enum value outside the offered set but inside the governing vocabulary;
- a numeric value outside the offered interval but inside the governing type;
- an extra field or child under a closed record/scope;
- an omitted required exact field;
- a governed reference outside the offered ref set.

The backend MUST refuse the negative probe through the ordinary
`OperationStatus` / `Diagnostic` surface and MUST NOT mutate runtime state. A
backend that accepts or silently approximates the probe fails closed-envelope
conformance.

### R7 - Manifest carriage is expression identity plus digest

A backend manifest that carries envelope semantics MUST either embed a small
envelope expression or reference a published envelope artifact by:

- contract id;
- expression id;
- version;
- digest;
- optional human-readable summary.

Both carriage modes use the same expression contract. The manifest carrier MUST
render through `backend_manifest_payload()` and validate through the manifest
contract model once schema evolution lands.

Current `realization_support.constraints` strings are not the envelope carrier.
They may remain compatibility hints, but they do not define membership,
subsumption, witness generation, or closure.

### R8 - Diagnostics identify paths, not sensitive values

Envelope diagnostics MAY name:

- envelope ids and refs;
- SDL paths;
- domain kind;
- relation kind (`membership`, `subsumption`, `witness`, `negative-probe`);
- non-sensitive governed identifiers;
- digest and contract ids.

Diagnostics MUST NOT echo credentials, bearer tokens, private keys, process
argv, host paths, backend-native ids, raw backend object representations,
hidden truth, scoring state, or full tracebacks.

## Invariants

**I1 - One semantic language.** Authored scenario families and backend
realizability declarations are compared as envelope expressions in the same SDL
semantic model.

**I2 - Closed-world is scoped.** Closure applies only at declared scopes and
does not implicitly close unrelated sibling scopes.

**I3 - Silence is not universal realizability.** An omitted bound is open only
when the owning SDL semantics designates that point as realizable.

**I4 - Subsumption precedes execution.** A backend-declared offered envelope
must subsume the requested envelope before conformance executes a witness.

**I5 - Witnesses are validated.** Generated witnesses pass the ordinary SDL
structural and semantic validation pipeline before runtime use.

**I6 - Negative probes are refusal tests.** Closed-world declarations require at
least one generated refusal test for each safely variable closed dimension.

**I7 - Public artifacts are secret-free.** Envelopes, manifests, witnesses,
fixtures, diagnostics, and conformance reports carry ids, refs, digests, and
bounded summaries, not sensitive concrete values.
